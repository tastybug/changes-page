## Portable Changelog

Simple library that makes it easy to show what`s new in an application. 

It provides means to store the information and a convenient access to it, e.g. by asking what changed between version 0.1 and 0.4. If needed, a simple HTML
summary will be created that you can show using some sort of Webview component.
